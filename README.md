# Propane_vs_heatpump_model
In Ennis Mt, my family has a large pole barn style shop. My dad is considering adding heat to the shop in order to keep it a constant 50 degrees. This project is supposed tohelp analyze the different appraoches in achieving this, by either adding a propane heat source or something else entirely (maybe a heat pump?!)
